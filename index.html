        <h2>Comfortably Numb</h2>
        <h4>by Pink Floyd</h4>
        <p>
            Hello (hello, hello)?
            Is there anybody in there?
            Just nod if you can hear me.
            Is there anyone home?
            Come on (come on, come on) now.
            I hear you're feeling down.
            Well, I can ease your pain
            Get you on your feet again.
            Relax (relax, relax).
            I'll need some information first.
            Just the basic facts.
            Can you show me where it hurts?
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no pain you are receding
            A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
            You are only coming through in waves.
            Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
            When I was a child I had a fever.
            My hands felt just like two balloons.
            Now I've got that feeling once again
            I can't explain, you would not understand
            This is not how I am.
            I have become comfortably numb.
            (solo)
            I have become comfortably numb.
        </p>
        <p>
            O.K (ok, ok).
            Just a little pin prick.
            There'll be no more aaaaaaaaah!
            But you may feel a little sick.
            Can you stand up?
            I do believe it's working, good.
            That'll keep you going through the show
            Come on it's time to go.
        </p>

            Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
            When I was a child
            I caught a fleeting glimpse
            Out of the corner of my eye.
            I turned to look but it was gone
            I cannot put my finger on it now
            The child is grown,
            The dream is gone.
            But I have become comfortably numb.
